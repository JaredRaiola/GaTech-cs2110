How to run in Docker
--------------------

In the docker terminal in the directory for this lab (NOTE: This is not
the interactive terminal from running ./cs2110docker.sh -it, you must
run ./cs2110docker.sh normally since we will need graphics for the Gameboy
emulator) run:

make emu

To compile and run your program on the GBA emulator.

Test it out before starting to make sure it works. You should just see a black screen.
