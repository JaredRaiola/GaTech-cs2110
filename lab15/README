CS2110                         Lab #15                     Spring 2019
======================================================================

(This lab is collaborative, so feel free to work with friends or TAs.)

Objective: To begin coding in C

================
Your Assignment:
================

Look into the four files provided: puppies.c, puppies.h, main.c, and Makefile
and implement the desired functionality described in the files.

Once you've finished, compile your files using gcc first, and then with the Makefile you
write, from either your terminal or from the docker interactive terminal. 
The docker interactive terminal can be run with: 
    ./cs2110docker.sh -it 
instead of when you would regularly start up docker with just ./cs2110docker.sh

If you use docker's interactive terminal, you won't need to open any browser, you 
can just begin using the docker tools from wherever you ran the script.

If you have questions about the compilation process, feel free to consult the 
man pages for gcc by running:
    man gcc
from your terminal, or ask your TAs. For this lab, you don't need to specify any
additinal compiler flags but for HW08 you will need to specify additional flags 
we give you.

Show your TAs the correct output when running your program to get checked off early.

Have fun!
